    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Most of the time in the lesson it was partner work, so I indepence was not needed.</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Yes, I did reflect after the lesson.</td>

    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I struggled to engage when we started to use the robotic arms as I did not gage how to use them.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In my learning something which could of been better is if we understood how to use the robotic arms effectively, this meant we were slow to use them. So, instead, we joined another pair and worked with them and started to understand how to use them, and what the code meant.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Something which needs to be changed within my learning is my engagement, this is down to the fact that when I did not understand how to use the robotic arms I did not try to solve it quickly, so by learning how to use it that means I can use it effectively.</td>
